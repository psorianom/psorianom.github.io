I am a Computer Science PhD specialized on Natural Language Processing. I am currently working at [Fanvoice](fanvoice.com), were we extract insights from crowdsource generated data. Specifically, we understand what people is talking about with ad-hoc topic modelling techniques. 

My interests lie in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Mining. I like creating and using large networks extracted from text and using their linguistic features to create single, enriched representation spaces. Then, I try to come up with solutions to NLP tasks by leveraging the structure of my networks as well as combining the features within.

Also, during my PhD and industrial experience, I have become very interested in scientific programming and its related topics: parallel/distributed programming, testing, experimentation workflow, handling parameters, etc. I also like running sporadically and making bread.
