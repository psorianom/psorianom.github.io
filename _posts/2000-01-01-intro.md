I am a final year PhD student at the University of Lyon. I am working at the ERIC Laboratory in the Data Mining and Decision (DMD) team, under the supervision of Julien Ah-Pine and Sabine Loucher. I am also a Research and Teaching Assistant at the Lumi√®re Institute of Technology.

My work is in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Mining. I focus on creating large networks from text by joining words and their linguistic features together. Then, I try to come up with solutions to NLP tasks by leveraging the structure of my networks as well as combining the features within.

During my PhD I have become very interested in scientific programming and its related topics: parallel/distributed programming, testing, experimentation workflow, handling parameters, etc. I also like running sporadically and making bread.
