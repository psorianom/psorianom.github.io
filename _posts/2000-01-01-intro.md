I am a final year PhD student at the University of Lyon. I am working at the ERIC Laboratory in the Data Mining and Decision (DMD) team, under the supervision of Julien Ah-Pine and Sabine Loucher. I am also a Research and Teaching Assistant at the Lumi√®re Institute of Technology.

My work is in the area of Natural Language Processing and Text Mining. I focus on leveraging large networks between words and their linguistic features in order to better combine said features and alleviate the sparseness typical of textual data.
